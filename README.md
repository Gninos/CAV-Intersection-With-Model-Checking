# CAV-Intersection-With-Model-Checking
This project implements an Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM) for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). It uses a Formal Verification technique called Model Checking, by using the Fiacre Language (http://projects.laas.fr/fiacre/papers.php). Fiacre stands for Format Intermédiaire pour les Architectures de Composants Répartis Embarqués (Intermediate Format for the Architectures of Embedded Distributed Components). It is a formal intermediate model to represent both the behavioral and timing aspects of systems, in particular, embedded and distributed systems, for formal verification and simulation purposes. Additionally, the Matplotlib, a Python library, is used as a visualization tool in order to analyze the behavior of the CAVs with animations.

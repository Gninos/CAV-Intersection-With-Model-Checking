# CAV-Intersection-With-Model-Checking
This project implements an Cooperative Intersection Management (CIM) for Connected and Automatized Vehicles (CAVs).  It aims to assess a more flexible use of intersection areas in urban traffic by CAVs. For this, the idea is to build state space abstractions by using Time Transition System (TTS) to execute the specifications of a CIM. In this way, each state represents a secure configuration of the merging zone with no car crashes, and each state transitions represent different decision-making options. To do this, first, the security constraints go through a formal verification chain that starts in therepresentation by the language Fiacre (http://projects.laas.fr/fiacre/papers.php). Then, a Time Petri Net Analyzer (TINA) toolbox (http://projects.laas.fr/tina/) generates a TTS that will be analyzed by a State-Space Linear Temporal Logic (SELT) model checker. These steps ensure that the design presents safe paths for CAVs that are in the control area of a CIM. 

This process produces a large Reachability Graph, so this strategy also uses Python libraries to treat the data and to extract performance metrics. The main Python resource used is the NetworkX library (https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/index.html) to create, manipulate, and study the nodes and edges of the Reachability Graph generated by the TINA. 

## How to Run the scripts?

You will need a Linux distribution to run the scripts. If you don't use Linux, you can install a version on your Windows through the Windows Store. Following the steps below:

- Access the Windows Store and install one of the Ubuntu Versions
- Click Start > Search for "Windows Update".
- Click on "For developers" and activate "Developer Mode". Click Yes to accept the change;
- Open the power shell in administrator mode and type: *Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux*

To compile the Fiacre scripts (.fcr files), do the following steps:

- Access the folder containing the file 'script.sh'; 
- Open a Power Shell in admin mode (shortcut: Alt+F+S+A);
- Type BASH at the command line to start ubuntu; 
- Type './script.sh file_name.fcr' without ''

After compilation, several files will be generated. The main files are a .tts folder (with petri net and time logic files), a .ktz file (this one generates the reachability graph data), and info.txt (it contains all the state and transition information you will need). The other files are .txt files that will be used to generate views in Python.

## The model

Basically, all Fiacre models have an 8x8 array grid as you can see below:

0's represent the street cells, 1's are the sidewalk, and the other numbers will be our CAVs. We have a cross intersection, so the CAVs can start from four different roads (A, B, C and D). Each road has four lanes. In the matplotlib each CAVs is represented by colored squares.

The transitions will follow some constraints to play realistic movements. For instance, in a scenario where the yellow CAV below want to cross the intersection (with no road convergence) and it is driving in a straight line, it can't turn over perpendicularly or go back to the same slot that it was. Also, it is not allowed to go ahead, because there is another CAV in front of it.  So, in this situation, the yellow CAV can only turn diagonally.

In the same way, if the yellow CAV is making a diagonal movement, it has the following options to choose from.

These constraints ensure that there will be no abrupt movements.

A round ends when all cars have had a chance to move. So, the model has a starvation-free property that makes all the CAVs to have the opportunity to move in the round. Moreover, it allows the possibility of a CAV to choose to pause and pass its turn.
